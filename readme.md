### Create a basic api 

```
/trivia/captial
```

Eventuall will have a basic trivia api that can call both capitals and
landmarks as well as everything else.




## resources

* State capital
  <https://github.com/jasperdebie/VisInfo/blob/master/us-state-capitals.csv>

* World capitals
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icyrockcom/country-capitals/master/data/country-list.json>

## TODO:

* Restrucure django apps, should have an api with urls like /api/capitals/
* Add frontend to django app with vvery simple webpage showing how to use api

## Structure

Yes it's insane and crazy to do it this way, I know that the data should be
stored in a database and I know that the api functions should be within the
django strucure, oh well - I like it this way.



### Create new questions

Follow the existing fomrat, then just copy the script and it should work.
